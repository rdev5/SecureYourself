# Secure Yourself (2016)
*If all you can do is talk about what is going on around you and be informed, you may as well just forget everything and go play golf. But if there is something you can do about it, then do something about it. -Matt Borja*

## Introduction
This ongoing compilation is intended to spend less time on rationale and more time identifying actionable items; a list of things you can do *right now* to secure yourself in this volatile and vulnerable environment we call the Internet. Determining if these countermeasures are appropriate in every situation will be left as an exercise for the reader.

Finally, if you see any corrections that need to be made or would like to offer an improvement to the current list, feel free to submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

## Secure Your Credit
You can mitigate (that is, reduce the damage or effect of) identity theft by placing a security freeze on your credit file.

## Secure Your Computer
A broad topic, certainly, but one you do have control over. Let's start with the basics:
- [AVG free antivirus and file shredder](http://free.avg.com/us-en/homepage)
- [Malwarebytes free anti-malware; detection and removal](https://www.malwarebytes.org/antimalware/)

## Secure Your Communications
These are methods for being vigilant as you move from one website, email, and connection to another:
- NEVER accept anything you did not explicitly request to be downloaded or installed.
- NEVER fill out an online form without first validating the website's certificate.
- NEVER open a file attachment in an email unless you are absolutely certain of its sender.
- NEVER click links in an email without manually verifying their destination and intent.
- NEVER send sensitive information (i.e. usernames, passwords, etc) in an email.
- NEVER conduct business, check your email, or login to websites using public Wi-Fi.
- NEVER divulge personal or account information over the phone if you did not originate the call.
- NEVER allow anyone to remotely control your computer.
- NEVER post content or photos that you might want taken down 10 years from now.
- ALWAYS change your password if a website sends you your password via email.
- ALWAYS turn on two-factor authentication where offered (i.e. Gmail, Twitter, etc).
- ALWAYS conduct daily or weekly checks to keep your software and operating system up-to-date.
- ALWAYS conduct periodic scans for viruses and malware, ideally no less than once a week.
- ALWAYS maintain a fresh backup of your most important files (i.e. work, photos of family, etc).
- ALWAYS keep your destination folders clean (i.e. Desktop, Downloads, temporary files, etc).
- ALWAYS use a file shredder to securely erase sensitive files in your Recycle Bin.
- CONSIDER using an Internet filtering software for proactively blocking malicious websites.
